# Brilliant Desktop App

**I don't work or associated to Brilliant.org, I just wanted a "Desktop App" for Brilliant**

This is a desktop app for [Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/).

Just a electronJS app with loadURL, and yes I change the User-Agent to "Chrome" for Google Auth.

## To Use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FreezingKas/brilliant-desktop-app
cd brilliant-desktop-app
npm install
npm start
```

## To Build

```bash
npm run make
```
